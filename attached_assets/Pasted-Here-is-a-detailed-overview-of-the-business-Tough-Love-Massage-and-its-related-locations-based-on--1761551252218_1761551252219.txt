Strengths & Considerations

Strengths:
	•	Strong niche focus: therapeutic deep tissue and pain management rather than purely relaxation massage.
	•	Multiple experienced therapists with varied specialties.
	•	Good reputation in reviews (4.8–5 stars in multiple platforms).
	•	Two locations (Holliston and Worcester), which could offer convenience depending on your area.

Considerations:
	•	Deep tissue focus means this may be more intense than a typical spa massage; if you want light surface relaxation only, this might not be it (they emphasize “strong-handed therapist” and working the source of pain).  ￼
	•	The Worcester location listing appears under “Tough Love Massage 2” which suggests possibly a satellite branch; verify scheduling and therapist availability if you go there.
	•	Always check booking availability, cancellation policy, and make sure you know duration/time for the session you book (deep work can require good communication of pressure and areas to avoid/have worked).
	•	Although reviews are strong, it would be useful to check more recent reviews to ensure quality and consistency are still maintained.
