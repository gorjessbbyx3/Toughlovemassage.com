This checklist ensures the redesigned website aligns with your vision: a simple, luxurious, enterprise-grade (Forbes 5-star spa feel) site with a minimal landing page featuring clickable location images, integrated FullSlate booking (with intake forms for new/prenatal clients), provider portal using Neon DB, email notifications, and pages for gift cards, join team, policies. It covers tech stack, structure, functionality, design, integrations, and testing. Use it step-by-step after implementation. Check off each item, note issues, and retest as needed.
1. Replit Environment and Basic Setup
•  Replit project created with Python template, named “toughlovemassage-website”.
•  Packages installed: flask, psycopg2-binary, flask-login, werkzeug.
•  Folders structured: “templates” for HTML, “static” with “css”, “js”, “images”.
•  .replit file configured to run the main Python file.
•  Site runs without errors when clicking “Run” (hosts at .repl.co URL).
•  Custom domain connected (if in production) or migrated to Vercel/Netlify.
2. Backend and Database Integration
•  Main Python file handles all routes: home, locations (downtown/suburban), gift-cards (POST for payments), join-team (POST for applications), policies, book, provider-portal (login-required), confirm, login, logout.
•  Neon DB connected: Tables created (intakes, providers, applications); sample data inserted (e.g., providers).
•  Email function set up with no-reply SMTP for notifications (e.g., new bookings, applications, confirmations).
•  FullSlate webhook endpoint (if implemented) syncs bookings to Neon intakes table.
•  Authentication: Provider login checks DB hashes; portal shows only unconfirmed intakes.
3. Global Elements (Header, Footer, Styles, Scripts)
•  Styles: Fonts (Playfair Display headings, Montserrat body), colors (light gray body, deep teal buttons/footer), hover effects on images, animations (fade-in, zoom-in).
•  Scripts: Location image clicks redirect, animations initialized.
•  Base template: Includes meta SEO tags, links to Bootstrap/AOS/styles/scripts.
•  Header: Dark navbar with logo, dropdown for locations, links to all pages, “Book Now” button.
•  Footer: Columns for each location’s hours/phone/address, quick links (gift cards, join team, policies), social icons, copyright.
4. Landing Page (Home)
•  Hero: Background image (luxury spa exterior), heading “Discover Ultimate Rejuvenation”, paragraph on therapies, two clickable location images (Downtown and Suburban) with hover/zoom, “Book Your Session” button.
•  Testimonial section: Includes original quote from Andrea L., centered.
•  Styling: Responsive columns, white overlaid text, no extra content—directs to locations.
5. Location Pages (Downtown Studio and Suburban Retreat)
•  Hero: Location-specific background (e.g., interior), welcome heading/paragraph.
•  Content: About section, treatment menu list (Deep Tissue $120/60min, Prenatal $130/90min, Sports Recovery $110/45min), providers grid (e.g., Jane Doe with image/description), hours/contact/map iframe, FullSlate embed.
•  Styling: Fluid images, grouped lists, full-width map.
•  Functionality: Booking widget loads; intake forms appear for new/prenatal (test via FullSlate).
6. Gift Cards Page
•  Hero: Spa background, heading “Gift the Gift of Relaxation”.
•  Content: Options description, gift card image, form for amount/select, email, message, payment.
•  Functionality: POST submits to Stripe, sends confirmation email.
•  Styling: Full-width form, primary button.
7. Join Our Team Page
•  Hero: Massage room background, heading “Join Our Elite Team”.
•  Content: Openings list (e.g., Massage Therapist), application form (name, email, resume, experience).
•  Functionality: POST stores in Neon applications table, emails admin.
•  Styling: List and form responsive.
8. Policies Page
•  Content: Heading “Our Policies”, accordion for sections (e.g., Cancellation: 24-hour notice, Privacy: GDPR/HIPAA).
•  Styling: Collapsible accordion, readable text.
9. Provider Portal Page
•  Content: Login form if unauthenticated (username/password); dashboard table if logged in (columns: Client, History, Confirm link); logout.
•  Functionality: Login authenticates via DB; table pulls unconfirmed intakes; confirm updates DB/sends email.
•  Styling: Responsive table.
10. Integrations and Functionality
•  FullSlate: Services/locations/providers match site; custom fields for intake (Medical History new clients, Pregnancy Stage prenatal); emails for new bookings.
•  Neon: Data storage secure; syncs with forms/bookings.

•  Payments: Stripe processes gift cards without errors.
•  Security: Input validation, HTTPS (Replit default), HIPAA-aware for intakes.
11. Design and User Experience
•  Aesthetics: Soft blues/greens, elegant fonts, subtle animations—feels luxurious/5-star.
•  Responsiveness: Mobile-friendly (test on different devices); no layout breaks.
•  SEO: Meta titles/descriptions, alt text on all images.
•  Accessibility: ARIA roles, semantic HTML, contrast ratios good.
•  Performance: Images compressed/ lazy-loaded, site loads <3s.
12. Testing and Deployment
•  Functionality tests: All forms submit, links work, bookings/intakes process, portal logins/confirmations.
•  Edge cases: Invalid logins, empty forms, mobile navigation, no internet (offline fallbacks if any).
•  Browser compatibility: Works on Chrome, Firefox, Safari.

•  Deployment: Live on Replit or host; custom domain points correctly; no downtime.
•  Backup: Code/DB backed up (e.g., GitHub).
