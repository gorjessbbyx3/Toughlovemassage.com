Tough Love Massage Website Redesign: Step-by-Step Instructions on Replit (No Code Version)
Overview
This guide elevates your current minimal site (https://toughlovemassage.com), which features only the testimonial: “By far the best place to get a massage, especially if you are an athlete or need some deep tissue work.” - Andrea L. We’ll incorporate this testimonial, add a professional treatment menu (e.g., Deep Tissue $120/60min, Prenatal $130/90min, Sports Recovery $110/45min—based on typical spa services; customize with your real menu), service providers (fictional examples like Jane Doe: Deep Tissue Specialist, John Smith: Prenatal Expert; replace with real ones), hours, phone numbers, and addresses (placeholders like Downtown Studio: Mon-Fri 9AM-8PM, Sat 10AM-6PM, (123) 456-7890, 123 City St; Suburban Retreat: Tue-Sun 10AM-7PM, (987) 654-3210, 456 Green Ln). Images use high-quality stock URLs for a Forbes 5-star luxury feel (e.g., elegant spa exteriors, interiors). The site uses Flask on Replit for backend, Neon DB for data, FullSlate for booking with intake forms, and email notifications. Focus on instructions, page contents, and styling notes—no example code provided.
Step 1: Replit Setup and Project Initialization
1.  Go to replit.com and sign up or log in (free tier sufficient; upgrade to ~$7/month for more resources if needed).
2.  Create a new Repl using the Python template, name it “toughlovemassage-website”, set visibility to Public (or Private on paid plan).
3.  In the editor:
	•  Install packages via the Packages tab: flask for the web framework, psycopg2-binary for database connections, flask-login for authentication, werkzeug for security.
	•  Create folders: “templates” for page files, “static” with subfolders “css” for styles, “js” for scripts, “images” for assets (download recommended images and upload here).
	•  Edit the hidden “.replit” file to set the run command to execute the main Python file.
	•  Sign up for services:
		•  Neon.tech (free tier): Create a Postgres database, note connection details. Create tables for intakes (fields: id, client_name, email, medical_history, pregnancy_stage, booking_id, confirmed), providers (id, username, password_hash), applications (id, name, email, experience, resume_url). Insert sample provider data.
		•  FullSlate: Sign up, configure services matching the treatment menu, locations (Downtown Studio, Suburban Retreat), providers. Add custom intake fields: Medical History (required for new clients), Pregnancy Stage (for prenatal).
		•  Stripe: Sign up for gift card payments, get API keys.
		•  Email: Set up no-reply@toughlovemassage.com with SMTP details for notifications.
4.  Run the Repl to test hosting. For production, connect a custom domain or migrate to Vercel/Netlify.
Step 2: Backend Setup Instructions
Create a main Python file in the root. Define the app with a secret key. Set up a function to connect to Neon DB. Create an email sending function using SMTP for no-reply notifications. Define a user class for login management. Initialize login manager.
Define routes for: home (landing), location-downtown, location-suburban, gift-cards (GET/POST for payments via Stripe, send email), join-team (POST to store in DB, email admin), policies, book (for FullSlate embed), provider-portal (login-required, fetch unconfirmed intakes from DB), confirm (update DB, send client email), login (check credentials from DB), logout.
For FullSlate: Use webhooks to insert booking data into intakes table and notify providers via email.
Step 3: Global Styles and Scripts Notes
Styles: Import elegant fonts (Playfair Display for headings, Montserrat for body). Set body background to light gray, text dark. Heroes: Full-cover backgrounds, 80vh height, centered white text with shadow. Primary buttons: Deep teal background. Footer: Dark teal, white text. Location images: Cursor pointer, hover scale effect. Animations: 1s duration.
Scripts: On page load, add click handlers for location images to redirect. Initialize animations. For gift cards, handle payment elements if using Stripe.
Include Bootstrap for responsiveness, AOS for fade/zoom animations.
Step 4: Base Template Instructions
All pages extend a base layout for consistency. Include meta tags for SEO (description: “Luxury massage services at Tough Love Massage - Elevating wellness to Forbes 5-star standards.”). Link styles, scripts, Bootstrap, AOS.
